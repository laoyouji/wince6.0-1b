; Rockhopper CPU VR5500 board has 128MB DRAM (0x00000000 to 0x07FFFFFF) and
; 32MB FLASH (0x18000000 to 0x1BFFFFFF). When boot from flash is selected
; by jumpers last 4MB of flash is mapped also to address 0x1FC00000 where CPU
; jumps on reset. When DIP2-5 switch is on boot mapping work in boot page mode. 
; The page has 512KB size and DIP2 switches 6 to 8 selects page to be mapped
; on boot. In boot page mode only 512KB frame is mapped to address 0x1FC00000.
; By default image is flashed to page 0 when it is dowloaded to device with
; platform builder. If page change is required modify ROMOFFSET bellow to value
; 0x11C80000 + page * 0x80000 (which move image to 0x99C00000 + offset).
;
; To allow simply flash update eboot copies itself to top of DRAM memory when
; it start (see eboot/mips/start.s). This allows to use lower part for OS image
; download or copy from flash. Top 2KB are used to pass parameters from EBOOT
; to OS kernel HAL. The EBOOT also uses last 128KB FLASH memory page to store
; its persistent configuration parameters.
